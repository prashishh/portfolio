						<p>In the summer of 2014, I was a part of an incredible team whose vision was to revolutionize the payment industry in South America. I was easily convinced by PayClip's ambition to solve real problems, their impact and the sheer amount of technical challenges in the payment space.</p>

						<p>At the heart of Silicon Valley, I had the <a href="http://prashish.me/2014/04/30/why-am-i-here/" target="_blank">opportunity</a> to meet and learn from the very best. The experience was the best learning experience I've ever had. I ended up being all over the place from design to development with full ownership to three major projects at PayClip in a short three months interval.</p>
		  		</div>
			   		
		   		<p class="payclip_more">
			   		Every project that I worked on was written using the technology stack that I truly believe in - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform" target="_blank">Open Web</a>. I consider myself very lucky in that aspect. I spent a large amount of time designing and building architectures and features.<br><br> 

			   		I used quick prototyping approach followed by a lot of refactoring and testing. I mades sure I had a lot of development cycles, where I refactored almost half the entire codebase in less than two weeks. I could literally feel the evolution of my code from the first iteration to the final production code.<br><br>


			   		I can go and describe the many <a href="#">technical challenges</a> I faced during my internship, but the lessons I learnt were the most valuable thing ever. I ended up going to many <a href="http://prashish.me/2014/05/16/code-for-india-hackathon/" target="_blank">hackathons</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/prashishh/status/479085622745776128" target="_blank">meetups</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/prashishh/status/492562739223465984" target="_blank">talks</a> and recreational events which included - <a href="https://twitter.com/prashishh/status/472112101574459392" target="_blank">snakes</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/prashishh/status/473195767834767360" target="_blank">biking</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/prashishh/status/463029199091953664" target="_blank">football</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/prashishh/status/480578661741895681" target="_blank">food</a>, and more <a href="https://twitter.com/prashishh/status/481274066502815745" target="_blank">food</a> - during my short stay in the Bay Area.

			  		<p>It is something special to be part of an organization whose sole mission is to promote openness, innovation and opportunity in the web. Being a <a href="http://prashish.me/2013/07/25/my-first-month-as-a-mozilla-rep/" target="_blank">Mozilla Rep</a> has provided me the perfect platform to motivate myself to collaborate and contribute to the Mozilla Community.</p> 

			  		<p>I have always been a strong advocate of the Open Web. I'm mostly involved with Mozilla by either writing code, volunteering in events, <a href="http://aoscacme.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">helping</a> local communities or <a href="https://yabbly.com/ama/inm6vrzy/ill-be-traveling-across-48-states-to-share-mozillas-story?sid=ajs5mzhy#question/cxjs8ieb/response/ajs5mzhy" target="_blank">encouraging</a> people to contribute. And also, I <a href="http://mozdrive.com/about-mozdrive/mozdrive/" target="_blank">drove around the US</a> to raise awareness about Mozilla and it's mission.</p>

		  		</div>

			   		<p class="remo_more">
			   			<img class="ui image medium right floated nomargin" src="app/images/prashish_mozilla.jpg" />

			   			Mozilla gives you the feeling of <i>doing good</i> and being a part of an amazing community of technologists, innovators and doers. It perfectly fits my lifetime goal to improve lives of as many people as possible and make the world a better place. I'm proud to be part of Mozilla and contribute in anyway I can.<br><br>

			   			My craziest project with Mozilla was undoubtedly <a href="http://prashish.me/2014/07/28/mozdrive/" target="_blank">traveling</a> around the United States to <a href="https://medium.com/@prashishh/how-mozdrive-started-af56d4be8a82" target="_blank">share</a> the true story about Mozilla and <a href="https://medium.com/@prashishh/the-plan-after-mozdrive-24aacb9cf2d5" target="_blank">committing</a> to publish an ebook.<br><br>

			   			I believe I have the coolest non-job on the planet where I am either <a href="http://instagram.com/p/uULpH2lZo-/" target="_blank">collaborating</a>, <a href="http://prashish.me/2013/07/25/my-first-month-as-a-mozilla-rep/" target="_blank">organizing</a> Webmaker activities, <a href="http://prashish.me/2013/11/10/experience-at-mozilla-festival-2013/" target="_blank">attending</a> the largest gathering of Makers or <a href="http://prashish.me/tag/mozilla/" target="_blank">discussing</a> future plans to support Mozilla initiatives in North America.<br><br>

			  		<p>The internship at MIC was a special treat to my long term goal to foster innovation and growth in local communities in Nepal. I consider myself super lucky to be able to contribute both as a facilitator and developer in my short period as an intern.</p>

			  		<p>The time I spent at MIC was a mix of creating things, motivating students, promoting technology and having fun. I was able to ship multiple projects, and also fascilitate talks to promote open web in Microsoft technologies.</p>

			   			I took ownership in building a <i>Dashboard framework</i> that was real-time, reusable, flexible and used the latest cutting edge technology. It was built such that any team could setup their own dashboard environment using this framework.<br><br>

			   			We were able to ship Nepali-English date converter App in both Windows 8 and Windows Phone platforms. The date converter was later ported to JavaScript and released as <a href="https://github.com/prashishh/NepToEngDateConverter" target="_blank">open-source</a>. It was then used for various other apps like <a href="https://github.com/prashishh/NepaliCalendar" target="_blank">Nepali Calender</a>. A public Web API was also built from it. <br><br>

			   			<img class="ui image medium right floated nomargin" src="app/images/prashish_mic_photo_1.jpg" />
			  			I was responsible to fascilitate three 5-day sessions to build Microsoft Office Apps using the open web technologies. Hundreds of Office Apps were built by students during the training sessions. I was also part of GWAB (Global Windows Azure Bootcamp) team to faciliate and spread the word of cloud computing in Kathmandu region.<br><br>

			  		<p>fortystones was a brain-child of five freshmen engineering students to set ourselves a platform to grow and share our knowledge to the world. Our amatur platform later touched lives of over 550,000 people across 216 countries and 12,000 cities worldwide.</p>

			  		<p>From writing articles, tutorials and reviews to building <a href="http://prashish.me/2011/07/28/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80-nepali-unicode/" target="_blank"> श्री</a>, we, as young students, tried to make a tiny-winy impact in the world. No matter <a href="http://prashish.me/2014/07/26/farewell-fortystones/" target="_blank">what happened</a>, I am extremely happy that fortystones was an invaluable part of my undergraduate life.</p>

			   			We are on this planet for a reason and the interconnectivity of the web creates the opportunity to help create a better society. We understood this early, and hence the web saw the birth of a small initiative called - fortystones.<br><br>

			   			The basic idea was to set a platform for ourselves where we could share our knowledge and information with the world. Each post was called a stone and each stone was ‘engraved’ with information that we found interesting or fun.<br><br> 

			   			We weren’t professionals by any means and we never considered ourselves experts in a field. We were just a bunch of guys determined to learn and share. And so we did.

This was before time when facebook was <i>'the thing'</i> and groups weren't omnipresent. Pushing emails to everyone isn't ideal if you want to share focused news. Scoop solved this.</p>

			  		<p>I like the whole idea of being part of communities of passionate people working selflessly towards a common goal.</p> 

			  		<p>We used to organize monthly meetups for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/109070762572263/" target="_blank">PHP Devs</a> in Kathmandu Valley. We did organize few casual hackathons as well.</p>

			  		<p>We also organized the first ever <a href="http://prashish.me/2013/08/08/developers-meet-nepal/ target="_blank"">Developers' Meet Nepal</a> where the focus was to gather all professionals and enthusiasts from all major tech communities in Nepal.</p>
