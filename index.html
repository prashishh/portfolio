						<p>In the summer of 2014, I was a part of an incredible team whose vision was to revolutionize the payment industry in South America. I was easily convinced by PayClip's ambition to solve real problems, their impact and sheer amount of technical challenges in the payment space.</p>

						<p>The experience was the best learning experience I've ever had. At the heart of Silicon Valley, I had the opportunity to meet and learn from the very best. I ended up being all over the place from design to development with full ownership to three major projects at PayClip in a short three month interval.</p>

I spent a large amount of time in designing the best technology stack, writing features and testing. I could feel the evolution of the codebase from the first iteration to the final production code.

			  		<p>The internship at MIC was a special treat to my long term passion to foster innovation and growth in the local communities in Nepal. I consider myself super lucky to be able to contribute both as a facilitator and developer in my short period as an intern.</p>

			  		<p>The time I spent there was a mix of creating things of value, inspiring students, promoting technology and having fun. I was able to ship multiple projects, and also fascilitate sessions to promote open web technologies in Microsoft products.</p>

			   		<p class="mic_more">

			   			I was able to ship multiple projects which included a date converter (Web, Windows 8 and Windows Phone) and a metrics dashboard. They were later released as open-source projects.


			  			I was responsible to fascilitate three 5-days session to build and promote Microsoft Office Apps using the open web technologies to over 200 students. I was part of a team which shipped Nepali-English date converter application in both Windows 8 and Windows Phone platforms. They were later released as open source. We were a part of a global world record to faciliate and spread the word of cloud computing in Kathmandu region.

			  		<p>fortystones was a brain-child of five sophomore engineering students to set ourselves a platform to grow and share our knowledge to the world. Little did we know that our amaetur platform would touch lives of over 550,000 people across 12,000 cities worldwide and 216 countries.</p>

			  		<p>From writing articles, tutorials and reviews to building श्री, we worked very hard to expand our horizons. With fortystones, we, as young students, tried to make a small impact in the world. Take it as a success or failure, but I am very happy and satisfied that fortystones was an invaluable part of my undergraduate life.</p>

			  		<p>I have always been fascinated by information sharing and social networking. Scoop was an experiment to play around with both of them during my undergraduate days.</p>

			  		<p>Scoop was a platform for students of IIITA to share any information, trending news and articles or stories within the IIITA Community. The idea was to share knowledge within their group.</p>



			   		<p class="scoop_more">
			   			This was before time when facebook was 'the thing' and facebook groups were present(?), but tried to remove the tradional way of pushing emails to everyone, but instead share in Scoop, where everyone is regularly updated about the happenings.

			  		<p>Think of <i>Siri</i> without voice commands. That's what we tried to build in my seventh semester. Again, without experience in Natural Language Processing, we dived into this topic totally out of curiosity and thrill to do something exciting.</p>

			  		<p>The idea was that the system would understand and respond to a user's question. It involved understanding user queries which was in the form of natural English language, using various tools to understand the semantic of the sentence, and then queried into the ontology for the necessary result, formed response and gave out response.</p>
